More government efficiency is always better than less government efficiency [1,2]. But, today is as good a day as any to
remember that the NSF gave us the internet 🛜, GPS 🛰️, MRI 🩻, AI 🤖 and much much more 🙏

😡 Some will criticise the NSF for funding research that seems frivolous, open-ended, or even wasteful. But, the exact same
open-ended research gave rise to perceptrons, backpropogation, imageNet, CNN, RNN, GANs - the foundation of modern AI. Yes 
many have commercialized these technologies (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, LLAMA, Gemini). But none of this was invented in a 
corporate lab --> it was all funded by the NSF over a period of decades. [4,5,6,7,8]

💰 Show me one corporation that would have funded this research, that too over a period of decades, without any guarantee of
success. The NSF has been doing this for decades!

Moreover, NSF spending has hovered at 2-3% of GDP for decades. But the resulting research has created millions of jobs,
and generated trillions in economic value. Regardless of how you feel about government spending, clearly not the right
place to look [9].


Here is a blurb on the topic from ChatGPT ---->
