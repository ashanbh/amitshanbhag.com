# Would you trust DeepSeek with your customer data?

Well, you really shouldnâ€™t.

The company claims it spent just \$5.6 million developing the chatbot, compared to the more than \$100
million that OpenAI spent developing ChatGPT-4, throwing the markets into a frenzy and tongues wagging everywhere. 

There is no doubt that DeepSeek has made significant 
strides in the field of AI, though it seems that the costs were greatly underreported, and that the true 
costs may have been closer to **half a billion dollars**
[^1],[^2]

But what's even more concerning is that they may have achieved this by stealing intellectual property from OpenAI [^2].
