More government efficiency is always better than less government efficiency [1,2]. But, today is as good a day as any to
remember that the NSF gave us the internet 🛜, GPS 🛰️ , MRI 🩻, AI 🤖 and much much more 🙏

Moreover, NSF spending has hovered at 2-3% of GDP for decades. Regardless of how you feel about government spending,
clearly not the right place to look [3]

Here is a blurb on the topic from ChatGPT ---->
