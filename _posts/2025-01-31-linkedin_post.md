🚨 Should You Trust DeepSeek with Your Customer Data? 🚨

Probably not—and here’s why.

tl;dr: DeepSeek = censorship, research misconduct, accusations of IP theft from OpenAI, and concerns about privacy.

👉 I created a simple comment moderation agent using DeepSeek. While it allowed some light criticism of Chinese interests, it inexplicably blocked pretty innocuous references - Tesla’s lawsuit against a former employee, or travel to Arunachal Pradesh.

👉 You could dismiss that as "just censorship", but AI systems play a critical role in filtering comments, content creation, content moderation, ad filtering, and social media ranking. Unfettered use of DeepSeek has the potential to tilt narratives and shape public opinion in favor of the Chinese government, cleansing your systems of any dissenting voices.

🚨 The company claimed it spent just $5.6 million developing its chatbot—far less than OpenAI’s $100M+ investment in ChatGPT-4. This news sent shockwaves through the market, contributing to a $593 billion drop in Nvidia’s market cap. However, later reports suggest the actual development cost may have been closer to $500 million - raising questions about the company’s transparency and integrity. (Sources: 1,2,3)

🚨 Even more alarming, DeepSeek may have stolen intellectual property from OpenAI. Microsoft reportedly uncovered the breach and alerted OpenAI, which is now threatening “aggressive countermeasures” against DeepSeek. (Sources: 4,5,6)

🚨 DeepSeek’s censorship practices are widely reported and deeply troubling (Sources: 7,8,9). But also has the potential to allow misinformation, propaganda, and violent content to pass through. (Sources:10,11)

If your system gave DeepSeek access to customer data, I'd be justifiably worried!
